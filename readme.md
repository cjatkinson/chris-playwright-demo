# chris-playwright-demo

This is a Playwright demo project by Christopher Atkinson.

The framework implements the page object pattern. The included spec demonstrates a pattern whereby a test is optimized to run in serial mode. The test evaluates four criteria:
* Are all of the interactive elements present on the page?
* Can the page successfully render a front-end error?
* Can the page successfully render a back-end error?
* Can the primary functionality of the page be achieved?

## Installation
